Progress summary — energy-trading-network

This README captures the interactive test and verification activity performed in this workspace (as of 2025-09-10), plus a short scan for likely redundant/build artifact files and safe cleanup suggestions.

What I did (high-level)
- Inspected the Java chaincode: `chaincode/energy-trading-java/src/main/java/org/energy/trading/contracts/EnergyTradingContract.java` to list public functions and argument shapes.
- Used the workspace `./network.sh` wrapper to call chaincode methods via the Fabric CLI (the script delegates to `peer chaincode invoke|query`).
- Exercised these chaincode functions in this order:
  1) `registerProsumer` (via helper script / earlier runs)
  2) `getProsumer` — confirmed prosumer `p1` exists
  3) `createPPA` — created `TESTPPA1` for prosumer `p1` and buyer `UTILITY1`
  4) `processElectricityGeneration` — first attempt failed due to timestamp format; then succeeded when passing timestamp in ISO-like format with timezone (yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ)
  5) `getGenerationEvents` and `getAvailableTokens` — confirmed a generation event and token were created

Important notes from testing
- Timestamp format: `GenerationEvent` expects timestamps in the format `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ` (example: `2025-09-10T18:45:00.000+0530`). If you pass a date-only string like `2025-09-10`, the chaincode rejects the transaction with an endorsement failure (parse error).
- PPA dependency: `processElectricityGeneration` looks up an existing PPA for (prosumerId, buyerId). If none exists the invoke fails with a `PPA_NOT_FOUND` error. Create a PPA first (or allow the code to auto-create one if that path is used) before invoking generation for that buyer.

Concrete commands I ran (reproducible)
- Query prosumer p1 (evaluate):
  ./network.sh cc query -org 1 -c mychannel -ccn energy-trading-chaincode -ccqci '{"function":"getProsumer","Args":["p1"]}'

- Create PPA (submit):
  ./network.sh cc invoke -org 1 -c mychannel -ccn energy-trading-chaincode -ccic '{"function":"createPPA","Args":["TESTPPA1","p1","UTILITY1","4.5","2025-01-01","2030-12-31"]}'

- Invoke generation with correct timestamp format (submit):
  ./network.sh cc invoke -org 1 -c mychannel -ccn energy-trading-chaincode -ccic '{"function":"processElectricityGeneration","Args":["p1","50","m1","2025-09-10T18:45:00.000+0530","UTILITY1"]}'

- Query generation events:
  ./network.sh cc query -org 1 -c mychannel -ccn energy-trading-chaincode -ccqci '{"function":"getGenerationEvents","Args":["p1"]}'

- Query available tokens:
  ./network.sh cc query -org 1 -c mychannel -ccn energy-trading-chaincode -ccqci '{"function":"getAvailableTokens","Args":[]}'

Scan for likely redundant / build artifact files
I scanned the repository for common build artifacts, packaged chaincode, tarballs, compiled class files and other generated content. The following items are candidate files and directories that are generally safe to remove from the repo (they are build outputs or packaged artifacts), but PLEASE REVIEW before removing — they may be intentionally committed for distribution:

Candidate redundant/build/artifact paths (review before delete)
- chaincode/energy-trading-java/target/  (Maven build output; contains compiled .class files, jars, etc.)
  - chaincode/energy-trading-java/target/energy-trading-chaincode-1.0.0.jar
  - chaincode/energy-trading-java/target/chaincode.jar
  - chaincode/energy-trading-java/target/original-energy-trading-chaincode-1.0.0.jar
  - chaincode/energy-trading-java/target/classes/*.class
  - chaincode/energy-trading-java/target/maven-status/**
- chaincode/energy-trading-java/build/install/energy-trading-chaincode/  (Gradle/Maven install layout; build artifact)
  - .../energy-trading-chaincode-1.0.0.jar
  - .../bin/energy-trading-chaincode
- packagedChaincode/energy-trading-chaincode_1.1.tar.gz  (packaged chaincode tarball)
- energy-trading-chaincode.tar.gz (root-level packaged chaincode tarball)
- Any `*.tgz`, `*.tar.gz`, `*.tar` under `fabric-samples/**` subfolders (these are packaged chaincode or test artifacts — check before deleting)
- `.idea/` workspace files under the Java chaincode folder — remove if IDE-specific and not required
- Various `*.log` or debug log files produced by networks or scripts (e.g., `network.log`, `network-debug.log`) — check `fabric-samples/**` and `test-network-k8s` folders

Why these are likely redundant
- `target/`, `build/` are standard build outputs and can be regenerated by running Maven/Gradle.
- Packaged tarballs (chaincode packages) can be recreated by scripts (see `scripts/pkgcc.sh`, `scripts/deployCCAAS.sh`, etc.)
- `.class` files are compiled artifacts — keep source only in VCS.

Safe cleanup suggestions (commands)
- To preview what would be removed (dry-run):
  find . -type d -name target -o -name build -print
  find . -name "*.jar" -o -name "*.class" -o -name "*.tar.gz" -o -name "*.tgz" -o -name "log.txt" -maxdepth 6

- To remove a single target directory safely (example):
  rm -rf chaincode/energy-trading-java/target

- To remove packaged chaincode tarball(s) you no longer need:
  rm -f energy-trading-chaincode.tar.gz packagedChaincode/energy-trading-chaincode_1.1.tar.gz

- If you use Git and want to remove generated files and add them to `.gitignore`, do this:
  git rm -r --cached chaincode/energy-trading-java/target
  echo "/chaincode/energy-trading-java/target/" >> .gitignore
  git commit -m "Remove generated build artifacts and ignore them"

Caveats and recommended review steps
- Before deleting any tarball/jar, confirm it is not intentionally committed for distribution or CI needs.
- If your CI pipeline relies on committed built artifacts (not recommended), coordinate first.
- `.idea/` can be deleted if IDE config should not be in repo; otherwise keep if team shares settings.

Next steps I can take for you
- Implement a `cleanup.sh` that safely lists and optionally deletes candidate files with a confirm step.
- Create a `.gitignore` update suggestion and commit it (I can prepare the patch but will not run git commit unless you want me to).
- Run a deeper scan for any large files (over a threshold size) and add them to the README if you want.

Summary / verification
- I validated chaincode behavior: `registerProsumer`, `getProsumer`, `createPPA`, `processElectricityGeneration` (note timestamp format), `getGenerationEvents`, and `getAvailableTokens`.
- I produced a candidate list of generated artifacts and packaged files that are normally safe to remove (see list above).

If you want I will now:
- create and commit a `README.md` (already created) and optionally a `cleanup.sh` helper; or
- produce a small PR that removes `chaincode/energy-trading-java/target` from the repo and adds it to `.gitignore` (I will not remove anything without your confirmation).
